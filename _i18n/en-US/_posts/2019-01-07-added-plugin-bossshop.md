Recommended by Fengshuai, I added BossShop to ES. Currently, it only serves as a GUI for frequently used commands. To call this GUI, do `/bs`. I will take a look into some other features this plugin offers and apply them if I see fit in the future. Feel free to contact me if you have any idea or suggestion on the using of this plugin.
