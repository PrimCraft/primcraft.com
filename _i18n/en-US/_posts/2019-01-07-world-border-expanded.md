World border has been expanded from ±10,000 to ±16,000. I set a warp `/warp s2` for convenient access to those areas. The expanded areas should have new undersea structures from 1.13.

Since 18w06a removed the customized world generation, ores will be generated in those regions. This change is not planned and there is nothing I can do, so you can now mine in the new region of the overworld.

Oh, and that shipwreck in the thumbnail is the warp location. I didn't open the chests so whoever is feeling lucky or just wanting to open it can claim their contents using that warp. Container permission should be granted.
