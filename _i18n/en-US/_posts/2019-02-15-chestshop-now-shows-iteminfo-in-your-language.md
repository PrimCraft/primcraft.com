Now when you do `/iteminfo [Item ID]` you will see the ShowItem info instead of the ChestShop item name/ID. It is especially useful for special items such as tools, weapons, and potions. Hovering over the item name will show you extra info such as the enchantments, lore, and potion effects just like a regular inventory item.
