Rules are just here to ensure a fair and enjoyable environment for all of us. Just keep that in mind, and the rules wouldn't be that much of a problem to you.
By connecting to our server, you are to agree to the following rules:

## Rules

1. **Use common sense**: Have fun and don't be a jerk.
2. **No cheating**: That includes X-ray, fly hacking, etc. If you are not sure if you can use a certain mod, ask an admin.
3. **Show respect**: No discrimination against other players, no harassment, building into/over others' spaces, etc.
    - For the building case, we recommend keeping at least a 20 blocks distance or 10% padding from others' building/plot.
4. **Be considerate**: Do not abuse public infrastructure/resource.
    - Many players may leave their farm and resources for public use. Take only what you need only and always replant/re-breed if it is a produce/animal farm.
5. **No griefing**: Ask for permission before using/modifying/removing other players' properties. No public lethal trap, random holes, random destruction to the natural landscape, etc.
    - In addition, any safety hazard without the user knowing the risk and a escape option before the point of consent can be consider as griefing, e.g. a random minecart in nether leading the user down to a pool of lava without telling the user is a classic one.
6. **No misleading/fraud**: Stuff like "jump into a lava pool with your gear on can get you a stack of diamond blocks" is not cool. Just stop.
7. **No advertising**: No advertising unless:
    - it is related to PrimCraft;
    - it is related to a well-known interest within the PrimCraft community;
    - it is non-profit and related to Minecraft.
8. **No junk**: Please cut your tree down fully and leave no ugly tree-leaf-flying-saucer thing behind. Clean your scaffolding pillar too.
    - This doesn't apply to resource world. Resource world doesn't need to look good and will be reset periodically anyway.
9. **Keep animal/mob count reasonable**: Just don't lag the server, or the admin will kill a few for you.
10. **Keep Redstone contraptions reasonable**: Just don't lag the server x2, or the admin will stop/break the device for you.
11. **Use bugs/features/glitches within reason**: Usually, if a glitch is not a general purpose one, you should be fine.
    - General purpose means, for the item duplication case, the ability to duplicate any item you so desire. So carpet/rail duplicator is NOT a general purpose duplicator and you can use it. If you are unsure if you can use a certain glitch, please ask our admin.
    - If you have a bedrock breaking glitch that works in vanilla, you are allow use it.
    - There is no extra restriction in the region above the nether. You can feel free to build there.
12. **Be polite**: No spamming, no personal attack, avoid cursing, NSFW stuff. If you need to post something NSFW, PM only those in interest or use the NSFW channel in our Discord.
13. **No politics**: Most political discussions usually ended in s**t shows from my experience, so no.
    - No puns/memes/satires on former or current Chinese political figures either. They don't like it.
    - Just don't touch politics. Go find another place if you have to.
14. Finally, our admin team reserves the right to interpret and amend the above-mentioned rules.

## Heads up on some unusual policies

1. **Alt account is allowed**: Activity on this server is treated on a per account basis.
2. **Share account at your own risk**: We can't stop you from sharing your account, but as mentioned in the previous rule, activity on this server is treated on a per account basis. If the user of your account misbehaved and resulted in your account being banned from our server or MCBANS, we would not accept excuses such as "it was my sister playing on my account" and so on for unbanning.
3. **NO account transfer**: Which means if you somehow lose access to your account, you will lose all assets associated with that account in this server too. We CANNOT perform any assets transfer if either initiating account or the receiving account is not able to confirm the transfer IN GAME.
4. **You CAN build mob farms**: Just don't lag the server. See rule 9 and 10 for details. Please also secure your farm so that it is not gonna be safety hazard.
5. **You CAN use many glitches exist in Minecraft**: As long as they are not general purpose. See rule 11 for details. And since we are using spigot, there is no guarantee on whether a glitch works in vanilla Minecraft would also work in our server.
6. **No politics**: See rule 13.

## What if I break the rule?
Dude, uncool.

We could take any of the following 3 actions, depend on the severity of the offense:
1. **Warning**: You will receive a warning. Our admin team may ask you to review the above-mentioned rules, and you may be tested on info regarding the rules after that.
2. **Local Ban**: You will be banned from our server. This ban is permanent.
3. **Global Ban**: You will be banned from our server, and will be reported to MCBANS which will result in a reduction in your reputation and may prevent you from entering other servers using MCBANS. This ban is permanent.

Yeah... We don't do temp bans.

### General rule on how we choose an action
1. If it is your first minor offense, you will receive a warning.
2. If you have a major offense, for example, intentionally modifying more than 50 blocks of what is clearly a building without permission, regardless if it is the first offense, will result in a global ban
3. If you repeated an offense multiple times, regardless of the severity, you will global ban.
4. If you are just offending some of our special/stupid rules, e.g. no politics, you will only be warned or ban locally. We cannot global ban you for that since it is not compliant with MCBANS policy anyway.

### What counts as a minor offense and what count as a major offense?
Usually, the following are considered major offenses:
1. breaking more than 50 blocks of what is clearly a building without permission;
2. placing more than 50 blocks out of place of what is clearly a building;
3. breaking more than 200 blocks of produces of a farm;
4. placing more than 50 blocks out of place of what is clearly a farm;
5. whipping out the whole animal population of any farm;
6. killing more than 20 animals of a farm without permission;
7. killing without permission of more than 10 villagers where the villagers are clearly protected by other player;
8. modifying a mob farm with a clear intention of disabling it without permission or sufficient reasoning;
    - It is up to the admin team to decide whether a reasoning can be considered sufficient, but usually if a mob farm is causing a lot of SERVER lag, or if the mob farm is malfunctioning in a way that is threatening the safety of other players or their properties, you will have sufficient reason to disable the farm.
9. repeatedly harassing other players;
11. repeat minor offenses multiple times;

Anything not mentioned above is probably a minor offense. Again, our admin team reserves the right to interpret and amend the above-mentioned rules.
